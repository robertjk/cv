CV of Robert Kusznier
=====================

This is my personal CV. It's written in LaTeX.

The repository contains both the source files (in `src/`) and the PDF built from
the latest version.

Requirements
------------

For building LaTeX sources LaTeX installation with XeLaTex is necessary.

Build
-----

To build PDF from the source files, enter the repository directory from the
command line and run `make`.
